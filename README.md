## Description
The Note Taker is a simple web application that allows users to take and save notes. The application consists of two main parts:
1. Frontend (Client-Side):
The frontend is responsible for the user interface and user interactions.
It includes an HTML file (e.g. notes.html) that provides the layout of the application.
CSS files are used to style the HTML elements and make the application visually appealing.
JavaScript is used to handle user interactions, fetch data from the server, and update the UI accordingly.
The user can create new notes, view existing notes, edit notes, and delete notes from the frontend.
2. Backend (Server-Side):
The backend handles data storage and retrieval, as well as any other server-side operations.
It involves using a backend framework like Express.js, which is a Node.js framework for building web applications.
The server provides API endpoints that the frontend can interact with to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on notes.
Data is stored in a database on the server.

Key features of the Note Taker application typically include:

- A list of saved notes displayed in the sidebar.
- A main content area where users can view and create new notes.
- Save and New buttons/icons to save new notes and create new notes.
- Functionality to delete notes from the list.
